    <h3>Woman Coding History</h3>

    <p>
      Women in computing were among the first programmers in the early 20th
      century, and contributed substantially to the industry. As technology and
      practices altered, the role of women as programmers has changed, and the
      recorded history of the field has downplayed their achievements.
